    ## ------------------------------------------------------------------
    ## THINK ABOUT IT:
    ##
    ## The count_lines and find_line are similar, and yet different.
    ## They both follow the pattern of "sandwich code".
    ##
    ## Sandwich code is code that comes in three parts: (1) the top slice
    ## of bread, (2) the meat, and (3) the bottom slice of bread.
    ## The bread part of the sandwich almost always goes together, but
    ## the meat part changes all the time.
    ##
    ## Because the changing part of the sandwich code is in the middle,
    ## abstracting the top and bottom bread slices to a library can be
    ## difficult in many languages.
    ##
    ## (Aside for C++ programmers: The idiom of capturing allocated
    ## pointers in a smart pointer constructor is an attempt to deal with
    ## the problem of sandwich code for resource allocation.)
    ##
    ## Python solves the problem using Context Managers. Consider the
    ## following code:
    ##

    class FileContextManager():
        def __init__(self, file_name):
            self._file_name = file_name
            self._file = None

        def __enter__(self):
            self._file = open(self._file_name)
            return self._file

        def __exit__(self, cls, value, tb):
            self._file.close()

    # Now we write:

    def count_lines2(self, file_name):
        with self.FileContextManager(file_name) as file:
            count = 0
            for line in file.readlines():
                count += 1
        return count

    def test_counting_lines2(self):
        self.assertEqual(__, self.count_lines2("example_file.txt"))

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------

    def find_line2(self, file_name):
        # Rewrite find_line using the Context Manager.
        pass

    def test_finding_lines2(self):
        self.assertEqual(__, self.find_line2("example_file.txt"))
        self.assertNotEqual(__, self.find_line2("example_file.txt"))

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------

    def count_lines3(self, file_name):
        with open(file_name) as file:
            count = 0
            for line in file.readlines():
              count += 1
            return count

    def test_open_already_has_its_own_built_in_context_manager(self):
        self.assertEqual(__, self.count_lines3("example_file.txt"))
